# LightTrack - LED Controller with Motion Sensing

LightTrack is an ESP32-based smart LED controller that responds to motion detection. It creates lighting effects based on distance sensor data and offers a web interface for configuration.

## Features

- Motion-reactive LED lighting
- Web-based configuration interface
- Background lighting mode
- HomeAssistant integration via MQTT
- Schedules for automatic operation
- OTA (Over The Air) updates

## Hardware Requirements

- ESP32 development board
- WS2812B addressable LED strip (up to 300 LEDs supported)
- Distance sensor (connected via Serial1)
- 5V power supply for ESP32 and LED strip

## Installation

1. Clone or download this repository
2. Open the project in PlatformIO or Arduino IDE
3. Install the required libraries:
   - FastLED
   - ArduinoJson
   - PubSubClient
4. Connect your ESP32 to your computer
5. Upload the code to your ESP32

## Configuration

### Initial Setup

1. Power on the device
2. Connect to the WiFi access point "LightTrack XXX" (password: 12345678)
3. Open a web browser and navigate to http://192.168.4.22
4. Use the web interface to configure the device

### HomeAssistant Integration

To integrate with HomeAssistant:

1. Configure your MQTT broker settings
2. The device will automatically register with HomeAssistant via MQTT discovery
3. You can control all parameters through the HomeAssistant interface

## Main Configuration Options

- **Moving Light Intensity**: Brightness of the motion-reactive light
- **Moving Light Length**: Length of the LED segment that reacts to motion
- **Additional LEDs**: Number of additional LEDs that trail the main segment
- **Center Shift**: Adjust the center position of the light
- **LED Off Delay**: Time in seconds before LEDs turn off after motion stops
- **Background Light Mode**: Enable continuous background lighting
- **Background Light Intensity**: Brightness of the background lighting
- **Schedule**: Set times when the light should be active
